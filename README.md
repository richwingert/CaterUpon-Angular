# CaterUpon-Angular
Angularized version of CaterUpon

This was originally a practice application developed during training at Revature. I have decided to update the technology in it to a modern web framework (for practice reasons).

The original description is below. See [this repository](https://github.com/richwingert/CaterUpon) for the original codebase

Cater-Upon is a website that connects local caterers with potential customers. It allows Customers and Caterers to login into the service, and collaborate to schedule catered events. 
Caterers can create a personalized profile that includes their cuisine specialty, reviews, and total rating from all past events. 
They can also specify an ideal travel distance, which dynamically includes their business in Customers’ searches. 
Customers can search for a Caterer based upon various search criteria. 
Upon selecting a local Caterer, the Customer can view the Caterer’s public profile, where they can submit an order request. 
Both types of users can view all upcoming and previous events. Users can also rate and leave a review on any of their past events

# Planned Technology (will update as necessary)
Front-end: HTML/CSS, Angular, SASS, ag-grid

Service: Debating between node.js/react for learning new material or java to practice existing techs...

Back-end: Probably mongo if I go node to round out the MEAN stack, or PL/SQL to go with Java/Spring
